= enterprise-script-service

The enterprise script service (aka ESS) is a thin Ruby API layer that spawns a process, the `enterprise_script_engine`, to execute an untrusted Ruby script.

The `enterprise_script_engine` executable ingests the input from `stdin` as a msgpack encoded payload; then spawns an mruby-engine; uses seccomp to sandbox itself; feeds `library`, `input` and finally the Ruby scripts into the engine; returns the output as a msgpack encoded payload to `stdout` and finally exits.

== Data format

=== Input

The input is expected to be a msgpack `MAP` with three keys (Symbol): `library`, `sources`, `input`:

 - `library`: a msgpack `BIN` set of MRuby instructions that will be fed directly to the `mruby-engine`
 - `input`: a msgpack formated payload for the `sources` to digest
 - `sources`: a msgpack `ARRAY` of `ARRAY` with two elements each (tuples): `path`, `source`; the actual code to be executed by the mruby-engine

=== Output

The output is msgpack encoded as well; it is streamed to the consuming end though. Streamed items can be of different types.
Each element streamed is in the format of an `ARRAY` of two elements, where the first is a `Symbol` describing the element type:

 * `measurement`: a msgpack `ARRAY` of two elements: a `Symbol` describing the measurement, and an `INT64` with the value in Âµs.
 * `output`: a msgpack `MAP` with two entries (keys are symbols):
 ** `extracted` with whatever the script put in `@output`, msgpack encoded; and
 ** `stdout` with a `STRING` containing whatever the script printed to "stdout".
 * `stat`: a `MAP` keyed with symbols mapping to their `INT64` values

== Errors

When the ESS fails to serve a request, it communicates the error back to the caller by returning a non-zero status code.
It can also report data about the error, in certain cases, over the pipe. In does so in returning a tuple, as an `ARRAY` with the type being the symbol `error` and the payload being a `MAP`. The content of the map will vary, but it always will have a `__type` symbol key that defines the other keys.

== Build

Run `./bin/rake` to build the project. This effectively runs the `spec` target, which builds all libraries, the ESS and native tests; then runs all tests (native and Ruby).

To rebuild the entire project (which is useful when switching from one OS to another), use `./bin/rake mrproper`.

== Using it

The sample script `bin/sandbox` reads Ruby input from a file or stdin, executes it, and displays the results.

You can invoke ESS from your own Ruby code as follows:

[source, ruby]
----
result = EnterpriseScriptService.run(
  input: {result: [26803196617, 0.475]}, # <1>
  sources: [
    ["stdout", "@stdout_buffer = 'hello'"],
    ["foo", "@output = @input[:result]"], # <2>
  ],
  instructions: nil, # <3>
  timeout: 10.0, # <4>
  instruction_quota: 100000, # <5>
  instruction_quota_start: 1, # <6>
  memory_quota: 8 << 20  # <7>
)
expect(result.success?).to be(true)
expect(result.output).to eq([26803196617, 0.475])
expect(result.stdout).to eq("hello")
----
<1> invokes the ESS, with a map as the `input` (available as `@input` in the sources)
<2> two "scripts" to be executed, one sets the `@stdout_buffer` to a value, the second returns the value associated with the key `:result` of the map passed in in <1>
<3> some raw instructions that will be fed directly into MRuby; defaults to nil
<4> a 10 second time quota to spawn, init, inject, eval and finally output the result back; defaults to 1 second
<5> a 100k instruction limit that that the engine will execute; defaults to 100k
<6> starts counting the instructions at index 1 of the `sources` array
<7> creates an 8 megabyte memory pool in which the script will run

=== Turning off generational garbage collection

In some cases, you may want to run a script in an mruby environment with the generational garbage collector turned off. To do that, you can run:

[source, ruby]
----
result = EnterpriseScriptService.run(
  input: {result: [26803196617, 0.475]},
  sources: [
    ["stdout", "@stdout_buffer = 'hello'"],
    ["foo", "@output = @input[:result]"],
  ],
  instructions: nil,
  timeout: 10.0,
  instruction_quota: 100000,
  instruction_quota_start: 1,
  memory_quota: 8 << 20,
  generational_gc: false
)
----

Take note of the last argument of `generational_gc: false`.

== Where are things?

=== C++ sources

Consists of our code base, plus `seccomp` and `msgpack` libraries, as well as the `mruby` stuff. All in `ext/enterprise_script_service`

Note: lib `seccomp` is omitted on Darwin.

=== Ruby layer

Ruby code is in `lib/`

==== Tests

- googletest tests are in `tests/`, which also includes the Google Test library.
- RSpec tests are in `spec/`

== Other useful things

 - There is a `CMakeLists.txt` that's mainly there for CLion support; we don't use cmake to build any of this.
 - You can use UTM to bootstrap an x86_64 VM to test with Linux while on MacOS; this is useful when testing `seccomp`.
   Ubuntu 24.04 Server for AMD64 is the recommended Linux image to use.  Note that the
   `script_runner_test.defaults_to_counting_all_instructions` and
   `script_runner_test.can_bypass_deserialization_instructions` tests will fail with `execution_time_us` being greater
   than `0` due to execution time taking longer because the tests are being run in an emulated environment. As long as
   all tests pass in CI, it's fine if they fail in UTM when running on emulated hardware. 

=== Ubuntu VM

[source]
----
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get upgrade
$ sudo apt-add-repository -y ppa:rael-gc/rvm
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install rvm build-essential git libncurses5-dev libgmp-dev libssl-dev openssh-server net-tools gdb
$ sudo systemctl start ssh
$ ifconfig # record the IP address for the non-loopback interface
$ sudo usermod -a -G rvm $USER
$ sudo reboot
$ rvm install 3.3.0 # (this may take a while)
$ git clone https://github.com/Shopify/ess.git
$ cd ess
$ git submodule update --init --recursive
$ bundle install
$ bin/rake compile

To SSH in:
$ ssh <vm_username>@<vm_ipaddress>

If you use VS Code, you can also use the _Remote-SSH: Connect to Host..._ functionality in VS Code to connect to the VM.
